# ytlofi
A Command Line Interface(CLI) that plays the most awesome YT song... [Chill Study Beats - lofi hip hop mix [2018]](https://youtu.be/-FlxM_0S2lA)
## About
This is a history of one guy who sleep deprived tried to making some awesome game changer application that will revolutionize how the music indutry works!..

obs: just joking around with you, guys. I wanted to create a CLI app and also a npm package, this came as one idea in _"what do do it."_
## Prerequisites
Since I've made all of it in a Linux enviroment I just know how to do it in it. Mac and Windows users must seek help for each particularity of attempting to do on those enviroments.

Install [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) and [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) into your machine, since Linux has many package manager, each one with it's particularity settup you must seek how to do you it.
## Installing
Most of Linux:
```bash
npm install -g ytlofi
```
Mac and some Linux:
```bash
sudo npm install -g ytlofi
```
# Running
Simple as:
```bash
ytlofi
```
# Running tests
All the future tests are going to be implemented using [Jest](https://facebook.github.io/jest/).
## Breaking down
_"Wait for it..."_.
## Coding styles
Since I inted to making this a TypeScript project in the future, there will be a [TSLint](https://palantir.github.io/tslint/) explanation here.
